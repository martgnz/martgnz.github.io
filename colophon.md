This website is set on [Freight Text Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro) and [Franklin Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Gothic), both served by [Typekit](https://typekit.com/). I wanted to achieve a modern look, while maintaining a classic newspaper touch.

The engine under the hood is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Everything is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with a little help from [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/).
