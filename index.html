    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a visual journalist at <em>The Economist</em>, where I make graphics
      and interactives. I am also one of the co-founders of
      <a
        href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/07/on-the-heels-of-its-own-success-spains-politibot-is-opening-up-a-chatbot-builder-for-other-outlets/">Politibot</a>,
      a chatbot about Spanish and European politics. Previously, I worked in
      Madrid at <a href="https://populate.tools/">Populate</a>, a civic tech
      studio.

    <p>
      Recently, I did a <a

      <p>Our coverage of the UK general election was divided in two parts: a poll tracker and result pages. The <a href="https://projects.economist.com/uk-elections/poll-tracker">poll tracker</a> was published weeks before the election, and the result page had a live forecast.</p>
<p>For the poll tracker we had a R script running every morning on a AWS machine to generate the data. The main line chart uses a combination of Canvas, SVG and HTML as SVG clipping masks weren't fast enough.</p>
<p>The result page lets you slice the constituencies by Brexit vote, age, race, density and income. This was inspired by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2008/results/president/explorer.html">Times graphic from 2008</a> (written in Flash). During the election night we ran a <a href="https://projects.economist.com/uk-elections/2019/general-election-results#live-forecast">live forecast</a> that predicted the seat count well in advance of the final result. I designed the pages, implemented the frontend and programmed the graphics.</p>

      <p>The 2020 Democratic primaries are the most crowded in decades. This poll tracker uses innovative statistical methods to asses the state of the race.</p>
<p>This was the first project we developed outside of the CMS. To fetch the text we use our own fork of <a href="http://archieml.org">ArchieML</a>, with support for custom dropcaps and small caps. The frontend uses Next.js and runs on AWS Lambda. I designed and programmed the pages and all the interactive graphics.</p>

      <p>We wanted to create a British version of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/11/03/how-to-forecast-an-americans-vote">&ldquo;Build an American voter&rdquo;</a> widget from the moment we published the piece.</p>
<p>To illustrate the divide between the support for a Brexit deal, remain and no deal we decided to use a ternary plot. James created a <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/graphic-detail-data/tree/master/data/2019-02-23_opinion-on-brexit">sample of 2,500 individual profiles</a> of the electorate using microdata from YouGov, and I plotted them. By adding a chart to the demographic selector we wanted to let readers find themselves in the data.</p>

      <p>This little widget accompanied a piece about identity politics written by Dan. The idea was simple: choose a set of demographic traits and see the projected political orientation. At the beginning we wanted to do something bigger, there are some sketches where you could see every demographic combination in a tree layout. It was a bit messy and the deadline was getting closer so we simplified the concept as much as we could and put this together in two days.</p>
<p>I programmed the widget (the &ldquo;random&rdquo; button is a lie) while Evan wrote the client-side calculations (it involves some nice math) and helped with the layout and the small moving dot. Matt made the other charts and helped with the design.</p>

      <p>The Big Mac index is the classic guide for currency comparison. It has been running on the paper since the 80s and as an interactive since 2012. Our redesign made it responsive and more explanatory. We did a long write up on <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-we-made-new-big-mac-index-interactive/">Source</a> that goes into more detail, but this project took months from start to finish. We even launched a survey before starting the redesign and worked with UX designers from the group.</p>
<p>Matt designed everything in Illustrator and I programmed the graphics and the overall React app. Evan ported the calculations from a series of Excel spreadsheets to a <a href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data">R script</a> and assisted with the transitions and a couple of bugs.</p>
<p>Dealing with currency was one of the hardest parts. The index includes 56, from the Euro to the Azerbaijani manat. For example, the exchange rate is usually calculated with a value of one to one ($1 to €1), but for the Japanese yen it has to be ¥100 to €1, as ¥1 is too small (€0.01).</p>

      <p>Forecast model of the 2016 mid-term election. After weeks of discussion we ended up with a design that prioritises straight chances —2 in 3 rather than 70%— and emphasises ranges. I coded the histogram and the generic ballot.</p>
<p>We needed to update the article every day with new figures but the CMS didn't really have a way to automate this. Evan wrote a Puppeteer script that generated the new HTML, navigated to the page, pasted the text in the content box and hit save (don't do this).</p>
