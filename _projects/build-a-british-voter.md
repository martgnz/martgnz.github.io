We wanted to create a British version of the ["Build an American voter"](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/11/03/how-to-forecast-an-americans-vote) widget from the moment we published the piece.

To illustrate the divide between the support for a Brexit deal, remain and no deal we decided to use a ternary plot. James created a [sample of 2,500 individual profiles](https://github.com/TheEconomist/graphic-detail-data/tree/master/data/2019-02-23_opinion-on-brexit) of the electorate using microdata from YouGov, and I plotted them.
