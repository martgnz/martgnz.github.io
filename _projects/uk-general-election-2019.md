Our coverage of the UK general election was divided in two parts: a poll tracker and a result page. The [poll tracker](https://projects.economist.com/uk-elections/poll-tracker) was published weeks before the election and the result page had an interactive map and a live forecast.

The result page lets you slice the constituencies by Brexit vote, age, race, density and income. This was inspired by a [Times graphic from 2008](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2008/results/president/explorer.html) (written in Flash). During the election night the [live forecast](https://projects.economist.com/uk-elections/2019/general-election-results#live-forecast) predicted the seat count well in advance of the final result.
