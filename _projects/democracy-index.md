The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) produces an index ranking 167 democracies around the world each year. In 2019 global democracy retreated to its lowest score since records began in 2006.

The main chart (which I would call a linked bar chart) is a remake of the [previous index](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/01/08/the-retreat-of-global-democracy-stopped-in-2018) with more annotation. I was still missing a broader sense of comparison so I ended up adding a beeswarm by world regions. All the charts were written with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).
