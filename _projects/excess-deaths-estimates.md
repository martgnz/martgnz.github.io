A tracker with a statistical model of excess deaths around the world. The model, calibrated with data from countries that publish death statistics, uses hundreds of variables to give a best prediction of excess deaths, which we estimate to be between two and four times the official figure. [The model is public](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model) and the data updates every day.
