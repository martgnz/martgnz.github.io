A better count of the casualties of the novel coronavirus can be achieved calculating a figure that we call “excess deaths”, a comparison between the total number of deaths, the expected amount of deaths in a certain period and the official covid-19 count.

This tracker aggregates excess deaths data for more than 20 countries around the world. I designed and programmed all the graphics and my colleague James Tozer compiled the data, which is open on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker).
