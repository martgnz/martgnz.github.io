The 2020 Democratic primaries are the most crowded in decades. This poll tracker uses innovative statistical methods to asses the state of the race.

This was the first project we developed outside of the CMS. To fetch the text we use our own fork of [ArchieML](http://archieml.org), with support for custom dropcaps and small caps. The frontend uses Next.js and runs on AWS Lambda. I designed and programmed the pages and all the interactive graphics.
