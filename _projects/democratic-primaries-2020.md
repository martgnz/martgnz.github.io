The 2020 Democratic primaries are the most crowded in decades. This poll tracker uses innovative statistical methods to asses the state of the race.

This website runs outside of the CMS. To fetch the text we use our own fork of [ArchieML](http://archieml.org), with support for drop caps and small caps. We built the site using Next.js and AWS Lambda.
