Catalonia held a election in December 2017 after the dismissal of the regional goverment. Instead of plotting the results by party we decided to colour the charts by support for the independence.

We did a map scaled by population density and linked scatterplots with a couple of demographic variables: people who speak Catalan, Spanish born outside of Catalonia, foreigners, median age, higher education and income.
