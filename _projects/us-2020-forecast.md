A statistical model for predicting the US 2020 Presidential election, in collaboration with Andrew Gelman and Merlin Heidemanns from Columbia University.

I designed and programmed the main electoral college votes chart, implemented the state pages and did various bits of frontend work. We tried as hard as we could to give a clear explanation about the chance of winning. The model is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheEconomist/us-potus-model).
