Forecast model of the 2018 mid-term election. After weeks of discussion we ended up with a design that prioritises straight chances —2 in 3 rather than 70%— and emphasises ranges.

We needed to update the article every day with new figures but the CMS didn't really have a way to automate this. Evan wrote a Puppeteer script that generated the new HTML, navigated to the page, pasted the text in the content box and hit save (don't do this).
