Obtaining Spanish digital elevation models (DEMs) is a messy affair. The official website is slow, there's multiple resolutions and it's hard to keep track of the tiles you download. While making a map I started writing a script to download data in bulk, so along with a friend I decided to make this easier for everyone else as well. The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/martgnz/ign-dem-grabber) and it was inspired by [other](https://dwtkns.com/srtm30m/) [attempts](https://dwtkns.com/srtm/).
