I am a visual journalist at _The Economist_ based in London, where I make graphics and interactives. I am also one of the co-founders of [Politibot](https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/07/on-the-heels-of-its-own-success-spains-politibot-is-opening-up-a-chatbot-builder-for-other-outlets/), a chatbot about Spanish and European politics. Previously, I worked in Madrid at [Populate](https://populate.tools/), a civic tech studio.

Recently, I did a [Reddit AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/cptmcw/were_evan_hensleigh_and_mart%C3%ADn_gonz%C3%A1lez/) about interactive graphics with my colleague Evan Hensleigh, gave a workshop about tooltips at [visfest unconf](http://visfest.com/unconf2019/) in Chicago, and [taught D3](https://twitter.com/DataJournalism1/status/1124601499772956677) to data journalism students in Barcelona.
