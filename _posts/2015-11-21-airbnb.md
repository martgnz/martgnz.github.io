        <p>This was the first long form published at <a href="http://www.elespanol.com">EL ESPAÑOL</a>. We analyzed data from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com">Inside Airbnb</a>, proving how 91% and 64%  of the flats in Madrid and Barcelona were published without any license.</p>

        <p class="u-italic">Tools: MySQL, Excel, D3.js, jQuery, Bootstrap and SASS. With a lot of people.</p>

        <p>My contribution was centered on the data analysis, the frontend code and some reporting. I designed the whole piece by myself and coded the interactives with <a href="https://twitter.com/sepirdata">Luis Sevillano</a>.</p>

        <p>After seeing the Inside Airbnb website I pitched the idea to my editor. He encouraged me to start working on it. After getting some data I had to dump it into a MySQL database, it was too much for Excel.</p>

        <p>I sketched several visualizations and maps. Along with Luis we worked on different implementations of the maps, trying vector tiles at first and then heatmaps. In the end we settled on a SVG map with a background image.</p>

        <p>We also produced a line chart comparing the Airbnb valuation to the stock prices of the biggest hotel chains.</p>

        <p>It was a long piece to produce. It required months of non-continous work, including reporting, code, design, photographs and illustrations.</p>
