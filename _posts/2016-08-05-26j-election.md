        <p>After 300 days, Spain is still on a political deadlock. After the last election (which took place at the end of June) everyone was wondering two things: will this result allow a new government, and what are the differences between now and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_general_election,_2015">December</a>?</p>

        <p>I already made several election maps, including one <a href="/general-election">for the previous election</a>, but this time I wanted to try something new.</p>

        <p>Inspired by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/04/upshot/senate-maps.html">NYT Midterm election maps</a>, I started to work with <a href="https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/">Tilemill</a>, Mapbox’s map design studio.</p>

        <p>At the beginning I was overwhelmed. But this project taught how to deal with details. For example, instead of filling each city according to the winning party, I calculated the margin of votes the first party had with the second and applied a scale.</p>

        <p>Looking at <a href="http://www.justinobeirne.com/essay/cartography-comparison">other maps</a> was essential to start understanding the fine line between typography, relief and the use of color. The tiles feature several layers. First, an <a href="http://www.theearthsrelief.com/">Elevation Model</a>. Then, I included rivers, lakes and roads. I used a mix of sources: the Spanish Government and OSM.</p>

        <p>After having a canvas filled with geographical, roads and waterways, I started working in the most challenging aspect of every map: the labels. Every zoom level needs a different balance between province capitals, cities, and small villages. I designed every label category using different font variants, text shadows and cases.</p>

        <p>The final maps are composed by two layers: the tiles, hosted on several S3 buckets, and a TopoJSON, which contains the election data and the city borders which are outlined on hover.</p>

        <p>Leaflet handles the navigation, zooming and search (powered by <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/">Mapzen</a>), while D3 triggers the tooltip.</p>

        <p>At the beginning we only wanted to include a map with the main results. But later we thought of including a map for every major party. This is one of the things that didn’t work: it was simply too much. We had all the data, yes. But instead of working with one map I suddenly had to design four divergent color scales, handle transitions between different states and generate and upload ten tilesets (to support retina screens you need to create a scaled tileset for each map). We shipped the five maps, but it took much more time than we thought.</p>

        <p>There are fair critiques against <a href="http://garciamedia.com/blog/interactive_graphics_less_is_best_at_ft">traditional interactive maps</a>. One of the biggest pains is that they don’t work quite well on the phone. Instead of feeling integrated they feel alien, like an external widget that behaves according to its own, strange rules. It’s slower to navigate between each zoom level and they make the user scroll and click again and again inside the map. The upside? It’s possible to create detailed maps with custom cartography. While vector tiles are great, it’s not easy to integrate them with DEMs and are complicated to manage outside of propietary solutions, like <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/">Mapbox</a>’s.</p>

        <p>After designing the maps I built two jitter charts. Using the same data from the TopoJSON I  worked with Canvas to show more than 8.000 cities at once. The first represents the vote to each party according to city size. The second, the difference between this election and the previous. This was traditional D3 work, but I spent some hours working with the SVG axes, improving the legend and the transitions.</p>
