During my volunteering at the [ÑH10](http://www.snd-e.com/es/nh/5244202538/congreso/2013) I met Lotta Ek, art director of the main newspaper in Sweden, the [Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/), which won a SND award with its latest redesign. The Spanish studio [Errea Comunicación](http://erreacomunicacion.com/) collaborated in this new approach to the Sweden's highest newspaper in circulation. Lotta was in Barcelona presenting the Dagens redesign along with his colleague Paul Hansen, who won the [2013 World Press Photo Award](http://www.worldpressphoto.org/awards/2013).

## The redesign of the Dagens Nyheter

**What were you trying to accomplish with this redesign?**

Perharps, one of the most important thing was to change the feeling, to get back to the feeling of the classic morning paper, because it looked a lot like an evening tabloid before.

**You worked tightly with Javier Errea (Errea Comunicación) on this redesign. How it was the experience?**

We did most of the job ourselves in the design group; he was a kind of discussion partner, a guru.

**And why this earlier transformation of the DN, from a morning newspaper to an evening tabloid?**

It has many different reasons, but mainly it was a combination of different editors in-chief that wanted different things. We had an editor-in-chief that came from an evening tabloid, and he tried to transform some of the things we did. He employed people who shared his opinions, who began experimenting with the design. 

But it also had to do with the fact that we made the newspaper smaller from broadsheet to tabloid, but we didn't change the content, nor the design. We tried to shrink everything and put the same amount of text and pictures into a smaller size.

Everyone could see it wasn't good. It looked boring. And when it looks boring, the first thing you think is to have bigger and bolder headlines. Big pictures and shorter text.

**This redesign had something to do with the earlier look?**

The reason we did the redesign wasn't that we had a lot of complaints of the tabloid look. That was also a reason to keep the _tabloidish_ feeling. We had to find a way between to satisfy everyone.

**And the transformation to tabloid? How it was managed?**

It was made in steps, during a long period, from 2003-2010, so it's hard to say who decided it. I was part of it, but if I could have decided I wouldn't have made it that way. In somewhere along the way there is the editor-in-chief, who decided to throw away the old headline font, the Bodoni that we used. And I think when we did that, everything was possible. It could change everything.

>The reason for the redesign wasn't a readers crisis

**The Dagens Nyheter can be considered a serious paper, but uses a lot of photos and graphics. How do you mix that? Here in Spain quality newspapers like _El País_, have a limited use of images.**

I think it has to do with the tradition of newspapers in Sweden. We never had newspapers that wanted to speak to a small elite. Newspapers in Sweden, in all times, have been very strong and big, and they reach everyone, from professor to the worker, all classes, all education levels. Of course there are differences, and Dagens its among the papers that are serious morning newspapers, but it has never looked like _El País_, and it'll never look like _El País_.

But there are different sections on the paper. The Culture section has always long text. If you isolate these pages maybe you could say that they look like _El País_, but the feeling on the whole is something different.

**The use of typefaces is intensive, both roman and sans serif. What fonts did you choose, and for which reasons?**

We use Publico and Guardian, made by [Christian Schwartz](http://www.christianschwartz.com/).

We choose Publico because we liked them, of course! But also because it has a lot of weights, and it's made for newsprint, so it suited us perfectly: the goal was to find a font that we could use for big headlines, both in the culture section and in the news section, and also to use it as a body text. When given all of this there aren't so many typefaces to choose from.

The Guardian font has a lot of variations too, and the x-height coincides with the Publico font. It looks very good if you combine them.

**Sounds like a natural decision.**

Yeah. Actually, if I understand the story right, he made the Publico font for the Guardian redesign, and they decided not to use it before it was finished, so they started to work on another font, that turned out to be the Guardian. So when Mark Porter (art director at The Guardian) redesigned Publico in Portugal, he picked up the old typeface that they didn't use in London.

For the Dagens Nyheter we found a weight of this font that it wasn't used, so at least we had some originality.

**So, what were your references working in the redesign of DN?**

In the beginning of the redesign we bought all the newspapers we could find in Stockolmh and we put out on the floor to classify them into categories concerning the design, from the most colourful, bold headlines, to elite newspapers, like _El País_ or _Die Tageszeitung_.

We look a lot of newspapers. _Público_ was the Spanish one, and the Portuguese _Publico_ too, along with _i_, who was made by Javier (Errea). We looked at _The Guardian_, we looked at the newspapers in Sweden, is very important not to be the same.

If it hasn't been for Javier participating in our redesign, the Stockolhm section wouldn't look like it does, cause that's really not a Scandinavian way to do a newspaper. With pink and bright yellow headlines on black blackgrounds. It's really quite ugly, but it's very efficient. I like very much the contrast between the sections.

Paul (Hansen) hates it, cause it's a picture killer, with yellow dots inside the pictures. The designers write arrows on the pictures, with text and headlines inside them. It's very fuzzy. 

So the photographers, if they can choose they don't take pictures for Stockolhm, or they don't put much effort on the assignments for the Stockolhm section, it's no point [laughs].

**Any american newspaper?**

There are not so american newspapers in Stockolhm to buy, I think that's the reason. _The New York Times_ has great supplements, but the news section it's not something for us, it's very different.

**And what is in your opinion, the best designed Spanish newspaper?**

It's hard to say which it's the best, cause it depends on what you want, and who you want to reach.

<q>The only Spanish newspaper that I've been looking a lot is Público</q>

**And which do you like the most?**

I prefer _Ara_ over _El Mundo_ or _El País_, that's my personal opinion about design. But if _El Mundo_ or _El País_ did the _Ara_ design they would lose their readers! (laughs).

The only Spanish newspaper that I've been looking a lot at is _Público_. I printed a lot of pages for inspiration at home.

**Bad news, Público closed in 2011...**

It sounds like we are going to have the newspapers a little bit longer in Sweden when you describe the state of them in Spain.

## Journalism, newspapers, and news design

**What do you think about the current state of the newspapers? There will be an end or they are going to stay?**

It's a crisis for the morning paper, but I don't think it's a crisis for the journalism. The readers are there and they want reliable information. You just have to find new ways in giving people what they want.

I hope they will survive, but just to look at how you read newspapers. Several days a week I don't even pick up the paper at home, I just read news on the mobile. So it's obvious that there will be more changes, and perhaps there will be newspapers, but maybe not seven days a week... And is not very convenient concerning the environment.

**And the role of the news designer? Is it going to change?**

I suppose so, but as long as there is a wish and the need for news, there will be also a need to people to design them, to make them understandable.

**But the websites have a fixed layout. If you have the design, there is no need in editing.**

It can't be the same for the websites forever. Maybe in the future it will be possible to do special layouts every day. But for now I know that, at least, in the US, many newspapers are working with longform text.

The old way to do a special topic is to make a supplement, with bigger pictures, stories, people, and graphics. But today you can do that in a digital way, to make something to read on your iPad. We talked about it and we have made some attempts to do this in our tablet edition, but we are not in the frontline yet.

**Every medium has its advantages and disadvantages. What do you think about paper and digital?**

The physical newspaper has a tactical feeling, and the possibility to navigate it's easier than on a website, I feel more in control. On a website you often read what someone else has decided that you should read, cause you start at the top of the page and you have to scroll down all the time, but it is also so much quicker, you don't have to wait until tomorrow for the news.

**And from the view of the designer, where do you have more freedom?**

For now it's easier to make things the way you want in paper, at least for us, but I think that that will change. We have to be more skilled in the electronic publishing.

**You will have to know HTML5 or CSS for being a news designer? Because webpage designers are coders, they don't know how to treat the news.**

I guess so! In my opinion is always good to know the background, even when you're page designing with Indesign is good to know as much as possible about the paper production system.
