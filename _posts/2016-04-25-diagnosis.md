        <p>I designed and implemented for EL ESPAÑOL a series of articles about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_diagnostic_test">rapid diagnostic tests</a> funded by a <a href="http://journalismgrants.org/">Journalism Grant</a>.</p>
        <p>The series has four articles and three international media partners: <a href="http://qz.com">Quartz</a>, <a href="https://krautreporter.de">Krautreporter</a> and <a href="http://efectococuyo.com/">Efecto Cocuyo</a>.</p>
        <p>There’s a landing page that serves as an intro of every story, and then each article. Thanks to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> I was able to generate static pages while still using shared components (as headers, footers, etc).</p>
        <p>The main objective was to design something easy to read and fast, but still beautiful.</p>
        
        <p class="u-italic">Tools: Sketch, Jekyll, HTML, SASS.</p>
