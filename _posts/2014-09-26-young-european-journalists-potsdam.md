I was selected to take part in the [Young European Journalists](http://www.m100potsdam.org/en/m100-en/youth-media-workshop.html) programme at the last minute. This workshop attracts every year the best young journalists from all over Europe. In this edition more than 150 students of 18 to 26 years old sent the application. 25 were selected.

The topic was of this year was "Data And Journalism. Between Big Stories And Dirty Surveillance". Extracted from the [M100](http://www.m100potsdam.org/en/m100-en/youth-media-workshop.html) website:

*To what extent is democracy endangered by data-mining security services and Internet companies? And how is the NSA scandal portrayed in other European countries? How, for example, has it been received in countries such as Ukraine, Russia, Armenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Montenegro and Greece, and what ramifications are participants from these countries able to report for their media and society? How do they handle data, what role is played by the defence of press freedom, protection of sources and personal privacy in handling and working with data?*

We were in Potsdam (40km from Berlin) from 8 to 13th of September, attending lectures at the [Potsdam University of Applied Sciences](http://www.fh-potsdam.de/) and the [Hasso Plattner Institut](http://hpi.de/). We also went to the [M100 Sansoucci Colloquium](http://www.m100potsdam.org/en/m100-en/sanssouci-colloquium.html), an international one-day round table that congregates every year 50 editors of the most important media organizations around the world. Representatives from ProPublica, El Pa√≠s or Der Spiegel, and executives of technology companies and organizations like Google or the German Pirate Party. The workshops were suited for begineers and intermediate data journalists covering a wide range of techniques: from data mining to visualization.

We visited the Google Berlin office and the Bild and Zeit Online newsrooms. Luckily, [Hacks/Hackers Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/) had a meetup that week. A lot of pizzas and interesting conversations, this time about data security and privacy.


### The Data Journalists Community

Everything was well organized by Sabine and Isabel. In the morning we had an amazing breakfast at the hostel and then we went to the lectures at the corresponding university (FHP or HPI). The day before the Colloquium we had a hackathon. I took part in an article about [weapons export and aid in the Middle East](http://m100-workshop.com/projects/project_militaryTradeNew.html). Despite the little time we had (only the evening) we managed to finish our project. Talking about the data visualization part, I did the main D3 map with [Datamaps](https://datamaps.github.io/) (thanks [Yaryna](https://www.facebook.com/yaryna.mykhyalyshyn) for your help!). [Krystina Shveda](https://twitter.com/ChinaCinderella) retrieved the aid data and built a scatterplot with Tableau.

The other groups also built amazing projects. For example, [Women in politics](http://m100-workshop.com/projects/project_woman.html) analysed the rate of women in the Georgian and the Italian Parliaments. You can check the whole list in the [Visualization Workshop](http://m100-workshop.com/index.html) site.

There's a website with all the content we produced over that week, the [Data Journalists Community](http://m100-data-community.m100potsdam.org/main/index). There's also an [interesting links](http://m100-data-community.m100potsdam.org/main/links) section with a huge quantity of resources for starting your data-driven investigation!
