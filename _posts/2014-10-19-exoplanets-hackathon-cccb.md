Last week a bunch of astronomy aficionados and data geeks gathered at [Estaci√≥ Beta](http://bigbangdata.cccb.org/en/sec-beta-station/), in order to participate in an hackathon organized by the CCCB.

[The projects](http://astro.hackdash.org/) ranged from the development of a Wiimote interface for [Stellarium](http://stellarium.org), an open source planetarium software, to AstroRift, an Oculus Rift-powered visualization of celestial bodies.

I had to leave early, but in the meantime I did a little viz with the help of the [The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia](http://exoplanet.eu/). This is the number of exoplanets discovered in the past decades. 2014 has been a good year, and the grow seems exponential.
