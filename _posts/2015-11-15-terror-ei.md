        <p>After the Paris attacks we wrote a story based on the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">Global Terrorism Database</a>. We analyzed the scope of ISIS: the killings, where did they happen and how.</p>
        <p>This led to an analytical piece with a series of graphics.</p>
        <p>According to the data the 67% of the attacks are made with bombs. Iraq is the most affected country (with a huge difference), in more than 1.800 events.</p>
